# Three_Body_Problem_Web_Application
This is my first independent web application project depicting simple solutions to three-body problems compared to general two-body problem solutions, considering generalized Kepler's third law. A structure of the application is going to be made completely using .NET technology (ASP.NET Core MVC) and the animations in TypeScript, CSS and Bootstrap.
